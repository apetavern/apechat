# apechat
A project for the s&box menu. Join and chat in channels with no history.

### Why?
This is a demo for a Websocket backend for a s&box game or menu. At Ape Tavern,
we plan to use Websockets for various reasons more in-depth in the future, so
this project acts as a jumping-off point and exploratory project.

### Running locally
- Open the golang backend in the editor of your choice and run it.
- Open s&box, add the project, and open the menu. The client should automatically
connect.
